Enter a number at the highest level to the console to select from the following options:

1. Enter multiple lines of input to the console, use CTRL-D (or CTRL-Z reportedly) in order to send an EOF to the code,
ending the process. The function will then print the inputs in reverse order

2. Enter a sequence of numbers into the console, separated by line. The code will return True if there is a 
pair of numbers whose product is odd, otherwise it will return False.

3. Enter a sequence of numbers into the console, separated by line. The code will return all possible permutations.

4. Enter two numbers, separated by line. The code will print the Hamming distance between the two.


The code will exit at the end of any option
